                    I learned by my own motivation to design mechanical parts in 3D, which allowed me to develop skills in
                    handling software such as 360 Fusion and SolidWork.<br><br>
                    Then I acquired my filament 3d printer with which I developed several projects, among which the creation
                    of human prostheses and toys stands out.

                    Coding is one of the tools that I enjoy learning and executing the most, since by integrating or
                    executing the ideas and achieving the result materialize and that also works properly, it allows to
                    obtain a degree of professional satisfaction.

                    Additionally, I think that the trend has always been in the programming and development of technology.

                    I'm passionate about the beach and I enjoy having contact with the sea and the sand, since they allow
                    me to feel a direct contact with nature, additionally I enjoy visiting some parks when I go for a walk.

                    These environments help to clear the mind, breathe a different air from the work routine, which can
                    sometimes be a bit absorbing.
                    These environments are conducive to meditate and ideal for awakening new ideas

                    I love reading books related to growth, personal, professional, business and health.
                    I am a supporter that the best way to improve the world is by contributing to make improvements, and I
                    believe that using this tool allows you to obtain tools to create answers to simple and complex
                    problems.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    I think that in the books there is more than enough information to promote new ideas of development and
                    learning.
